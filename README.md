# PlutoSurface-Roughness
Pluto surface roughness code based on Buratti et al., 1985
These sets of scripts were generated in succession of the Europa Photometry code. There are three main sets of scripts. LORRI_Solar_phase_curve.ipynb lets you look at the LORRI data cube, observation geometry of the cube, and compare it to Hillier et al., Figure 2. Pluto_test_fixed.ipynb lets one extract the pixels by creating a mask for a specific geological region (Sputnik Planitia, Bladed Units, Washboard Terrain), observation geometry, latitude or longitude and write it in a csv file for plotting or further analysis. The final script Roughness_curve.ipynb is the actual surface roughness code derived from Buratti et al., 1985 and re-written in Python. It generates a theoretical family of curves and lets one plot the data on top of the theoeretical model.
